//A few examples regarding kinds, units, and meta-units:
//human and atomic units are abstractions across domains and can be thought of as meta-units:
// * human:  BTC, ETH, SOL, ...
// * atomic: Satoshi, Wei, or Lamport
//
//The idea of "atomic" being that in the real world, there's no mechanism to deal with units
//  smaller than that.
//
//Edge cases:
// * USD (Base unit: $):
//     The human unit is clearly "$", but the atomic unit is already somewhat murkier, though
//     arguably still cents (though sub-cent settlements can pop up in e.g. micro payments).
// * Information (Base unit: bit):
//     No atomic unit, but the human unit is clearly "bit".
//     (While e.g. Trits and Nats are also semi-common)
// * Computer storage (Base unit: byte):
//     No human unit, but the atomic unit is clearly "byte".
// * Time (Base unit: s):
//     No human unit, because it's mostly context dependent - from nanoseconds to years.
//     And likewise, not really an atomic unit either (except perhaps Planck seconds).
