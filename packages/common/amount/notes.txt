Original Notes:
  substrate [Domain | "Offchain"/"Rwa"]
  dimension [eth, avax, sol, usd, Erc20Token1, Erc20Token2, ...]
  units [eth, gwei, wei], [dollar, cent], [sol, lamports]
  meta-units [human, atomic]
  custom default units (most in human but e.g. gas prices in gwei)
  should support both static and dynamic polymorphism, e.g. all Erc20Tokens should have a common
  base class
  associated meta information (e.g. for ERC20 on-chain address, symbol)

  2 types:
  * actual amounts
  * prices & conversions, i.e. amount of asset1 per unit amount of asset2
  - conversions are fixed at compile time between related assets (e.g. native vs wrapped tokens)
    while prices change at runtime
  gasPrice

TODO:
  - parsing?
  - better formatting
